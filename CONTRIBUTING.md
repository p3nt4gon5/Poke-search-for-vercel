## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use the following prefixes for branch names:
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates

Examples:
- `feature/admin-pokemon-management`
- `bugfix/search-typo-handling`
- `refactor/auth-context-optimization`

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat(search): add fuzzy search with typo tolerance`
- `fix(auth): resolve Google OAuth redirect issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components small and focused

### Testing

- Test new features manually
- Ensure existing functionality works

- Never modify existing migration files
- Test migrations on development database
- Document schema changes in PR description
